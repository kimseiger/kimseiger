### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kimseiger/kimseiger** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ I am a Scrum Master and Project Manager who used to write code back in the TFS days.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub so I can interact better with the development teams that I support.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Scrum, Penn State, or hiking in the PA state parks!
